This directory contains an archive of scripts that were used to build a standalone
shell-based installer for Tad.

This approach couldn't support auto-update so was abandoned in favor of electron-builder, which creates and distributes a DMG file.

Scripts kept here in this directory because they have a few useful snippets we may need and don't
yet want to troll through git history to find them.
